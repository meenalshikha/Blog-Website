# Blog-Website
I created a complete blog website using HTML and CSS for the frontend, with PHP and MySQL handling the backend and database. The site includes user signup, login functionality, and a dashboard where users can view, edit, or delete their data. This project demonstrates full-stack development using core web technologies.
